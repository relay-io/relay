# Relay
A simple, no-nonsense, stateless job runner

Relay is designed to be simple, reliable and easy to use. It on purpose does not track `Job` history, keep logs or 
retains Job run information after it completes embracing the unix philosophy of doing one thing and doing it well.

A Job runner is like a Relay race, you hand the baton off in turn to be handed off again and so on until the end of the race. 
The race itself doesn't record the times, video itself or announce the outcomes; but rather those are done externally.
